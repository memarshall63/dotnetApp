# dotnetApp 
## Logging with AppInsights
This is a POC dotnet application based on the template WebAPI app that is create as an example with the command:

> dotnet new webapi

The template has been changed to support a couple of things.  The first is to add a 'logger'.  This is just a basic logger that can be used to create logging messages to a console or to a file.
