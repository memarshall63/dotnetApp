This is a basic dotnet app that should run with a simple:

dotnet run

the app comes up offering the Swagger/WeatherForecast sample app.   There's a script called:

curl_it.sh

that will fire requests off of the website. The app has been tied in with AppInsights.

You should be able to see requests there.
